# Algorithm-to-collect-data-UAV_IEEE802.15.4_Sensor_Network
Script to collect data between UAV and IEEE 802.15.4-enabled wireless node.
Collecting data from sensor nodes that are part of large-scale linear infrastructures, such as monitoring pipelines to transport oil, is challenging when wireless connectivity and the IEEE 802.15.4 standard are used. Due to rapid deployment, using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to collect data from the nodes is a low-cost and portable alternative. Furthermore, using a UAV avoids creating multi-hop linear topologies, which demand computer capacity and energy resources. It is important to mention that All codes that  start with NODO run in Microchip Studio, and the Python code runs in PyCharm.
