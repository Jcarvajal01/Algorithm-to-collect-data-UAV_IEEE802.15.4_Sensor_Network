Script to collect data between UAV and IEEE 802.15.4-enabled wireless node.
Collecting data from sensor nodes that are part of large-scale linear infrastructures,
such as monitoring pipelines to transport oil, is challenging when wireless connectivity
and the IEEE 802.15.4 standard are used. Due to rapid deployment, using unmanned aerial
vehicles (UAVs) to collect data from the nodes is a low-cost and portable alternative.
Furthermore, using a UAV avoids creating multi-hop linear topologies, which demand 
computer capacity and energy resources.
